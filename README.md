# How to use

Just run the following command in powershell:
```
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UserName-None/Fix-Windows-Managed-by-Organisation/main/script.ps1 | iex
```

# What this is
This is a simple PowerShell script that solves the "Your system is managed by your organisation" for both Windows and Microsoft Edge. It has been tested on Windows 11, and it solves the problem by deleting some specific registry entries. However, I recommend you do a system backup and a restore point in case something goes wrong.
